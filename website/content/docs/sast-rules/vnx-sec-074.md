title: "VNX-SEC-074 – Kubernetes Secret Manifest with Credentials"
description: "Detects Kubernetes Secret manifests with data or stringData fields committed in YAML files."
---

## Overview

This rule detects kubernetes secret manifest with credentials matching the `kind: Secret ... data: or stringData:` pattern hardcoded anywhere in source files. Detects Kubernetes Secret manifests with data or stringData fields committed in YAML files.

**Severity:** High | **CWE:** [CWE-798 – Use of Hard-coded Credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)

## Why This Matters

Hardcoded kubernetes secret manifest with credentials values are routinely scraped by automated bots within minutes of a public push, and then used to access the account, exfiltrate data, or pivot into downstream services. Once the credential is in git history it is permanently in third-party hands.

## Remediation

1. **Revoke the leaked credential** in the provider's console immediately.
2. **Replace with a short-lived alternative** — OAuth 2.0 access tokens, IAM role assumption, OIDC federation — wherever the platform supports it.
3. **Store the new credential in a secrets manager** (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, GitHub Actions secrets, Doppler).
4. **Audit the provider's access logs** for activity you did not initiate between the leak and the revocation.
5. **Purge from git history** with `git filter-repo` or BFG, then re-scan with gitleaks/truffleHog to confirm no other secrets remain.
6. **Enable push protection** so future commits are blocked at the developer machine.
